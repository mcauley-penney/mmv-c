# mmv-c ðŸ“¦
Edit file and directory names in `$EDITOR`. Inspired by [itchyny/mmv](https://github.com/itchyny/mmv).

## about
I like and frequently use the base functionality of the original, linked above. I've implemented it before [in shell](https://github.com/mcauley-penney/mmv.sh) and wanted to try my hand at a C implementation.

This version forgoes some of the features of the original that I don't use and don't need, such as cyclical renaming. See it for a more featureful experience.


## usage
Like other command line tools, `mmv` accepts wildcards and special paths, such as `..`
